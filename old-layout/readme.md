This is based on my old application layout.

I don't know where the CSS file is... I'll have to look at my old laptop.

Some important things here:

- **layout**: missing CSS (need to find it)
- **mdarray.js**: manipulate many javascript objects as if they were one
- **history-api**: some tests with the browser history API
